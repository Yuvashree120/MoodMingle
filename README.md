# MoodMingle
DECRIPTION:
Modmingle is a simple Java mini-project where people (users) can join, share their mood, and get matches or suggestions.
It is a console-based program that uses Java OOP concepts like classes, objects, and collections.
The idea is to “mingle based on mood” – users with the same mood can connect, and the app also gives fun suggestions like movies, songs, or books.

FEATURES:
Create User → Add a new user with details (like name, mood, etc.).
Show All Users → Display all registered users.
Find Matches (Same Mood) → Find users who share the same mood.
Delete User → Remove a user from the system.
Get Suggestions → Suggest movies, songs, or books based on the user’s mood.
Exit → Close the program.
